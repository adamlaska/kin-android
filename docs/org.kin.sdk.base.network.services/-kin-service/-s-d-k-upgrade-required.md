# SDKUpgradeRequired

`object SDKUpgradeRequired : `[`RuntimeException`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-runtime-exception/index.html)

It is expected that this error is handled gracefully by notifying users
to upgrade to a newer version of the software that should contain a more
recent version of this SDK.
