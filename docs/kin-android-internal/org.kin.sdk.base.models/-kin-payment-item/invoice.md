# invoice

`val invoice: `[`Optional`](../../org.kin.sdk.base.tools/-optional/index.md)`<`[`Invoice`](../-invoice/index.md)`>`
* (optional) - an Invoice that this transfer refers to. [amount](amount.md) should match invoice.total, but is not strictly enforced. Where they differ [amount](amount.md) will be the kin actually transferred.
